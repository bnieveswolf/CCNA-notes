What are ACLs?
ACL Logic
ACL types
Standard numbered ACLs
Standard named ACls

ACLs (Access Control Lists):
    Have multiple uses.
    ACLs function as a packet filter, instructing the router to permit or discard specific traffic.
    ACLs can filter traffic based on source/destination IP addresses, source/destination Layer 4 ports, etc.
    ACLs are configures globally on the router in global conmfig mode.
    They are made up of an ordered sequence of ACEs (access Control Entries)

Example:

â€¢ REQUIREMENT:
Hosts in 192.168.1.0/24 can access the 10.0.1.0/24 network 
Hosts in 192.168.2.0/24 cannot access the 10.0.1.0/24 network

ACL 1:
    1: if source IP = 192.168.1.0/24,
    then permit
    2: if source IP = 192.168.2.0/24,then deny
    3: if source IP = any, then permit

In order for ACLs to take effect, they must first be created, then applied to an interface.
They are aplied either inbound or outbound.

Implicit deny- if a packet doesnt match any entry in an ACL, then it is automatically denied. 

2 Types of ACLs:
Standard ACLs: Match based on Source IP address only.
    Standard Numbered ACLs
    Standard Named ACLs
Extended ACLs: Match based on Source/Destination IP, Source/Destination port, etc.
    Extended Numbered ACLs
    Extended Named ACLs

Command for standard numbered ACLs:
R1(config)#access-list number {deny|permit} ip wildcard-mask

Commands for standard ACL:
Deny:
    R1(config)#access-list 1 deny 1.1.1.1 0.0.0.0
    R1(config)#access-list 1 deny 1.1.1.1
    R1(config)#access-list 1 deny host 1.1.1.1

Permit:
    R1(config)#access-list 1 permit any
    R1(config)#access-list 1 permit 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255

Description:
    R1(config)#access-list 1 remark ## BLOCK BOB FROM ACCOUNTING ##
    R1(config)#do show access-lists

Apply to an Interface:
    R1(config-if)ip access-group number {in|out}
